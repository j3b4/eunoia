# Itch bods, bodies, bots
The game is infested with bodies that look and act, as much as possible, like 
other players but are just bots.  They are meant to provide a challenge to 
finding real intimacy with real players by being distracting.

In singular eunoia they merely float in the love soup and occasionally ping 
other players. They responde enthusiastically to being pinged. If other forms
of communication are available they will try to engage as well.
