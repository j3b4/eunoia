# Traits mega list, 
One word per line. Insert into # Intake;  I'll vet them according to my mysterious preferences and move them into #cannon,  #alternative.

## Guidelines
Traits should be adjectives that could describe an organism wholistically (rather than just one part for example). They should not be words that suggest a 
particular gender or species of organism. Also avoid purely cultural or political attitudes like "traditional", "conservative", "strident".  But personality
traits like "loving", "warm", "aloof" might be okay.  Look through the list of "cannon" traits for examples as well.  But when in doubt, just put a word in, 
It's better to have too many choices.
