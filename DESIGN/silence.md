# Silence 

This is a project to remove or disable the built-in communication commands that
allow players to type messages for other players to read.  Whether through
public channels, broadcast, direct private messages or even poses or "emotes",
these commands all need to be eliminated so that full syntactic communcation
can be reserved for use only by players who have acheived the requisite level
of intimacy.

# List of commands to silence:

* all channels
* say
* whisper
* pose

## Method

plans for how to disable these commands.

### re-write the default cmdset. 
I think there is a default cmdset. If so I can remove the commands from that.

### change permissions on the commands
Maybe this even better. Limit the commands in question to helpers or builders
and above.

I think this involves overriding the commands in my game folders and,
for now at least, simply changing the permission/locks.

We'll see.
