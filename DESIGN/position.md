# Positioning
What is the absolute minimal ammount of positionin information that needs to 
exist. In my imagination I can get by with one single absolute position called
'home' or 'creche' or 'spawn' or something. (Try to have a little fun maybe.)

So the only absolute information about position that can exist is how far away
one is from 'home'. After that all other information is relative to other 
bodies. For every body you are either of one of the following distances:
touching, close, around, far, and lost. If I can think of other words that are 
unambiguous in order perhaps I could change up or add to this list. 

The limit of ping might be far. Lost implies a distance so great that no 
information can pass directly between both bodies. 

Let us imagine X pings and hears pongs from A, B, and C. Can the pongs tell X 
whether A,B, or C are near eachother? If sound indicates direction then yes. 
All we need to know is that A and B for example are both "far" but in the same
direction as eachother. Without knowing what direction we know that if we 
approach A, we will also get closer to B. If C is around X but in a different
direction then we can guess that C will be far from or even "lost" to A and B.
Moving toward C will take us away from A and B. 

Once another body is 'lost' to us there is no way of finding it again except
by chance or meta- mechanics. The spawn point is an exception as all bodies can
always find it again.

# Design ideas
When drifting, hunting, or seeking other bodies the computer
tracks how far each body is from the creche or spawn-point. Everybody has a 
chance of meeting up with other bodies based on their distance from the fixed
point. Once a body is a known distance to another body then their position 
is recorded relative to that body and potentially to other bodies that are
around it. But perhaps far bodies are not shared.

So if X moves away from home until they are far from home and discovers A. They
will be assigned a distance to A. Say "around". If A is also "around" B then X
will be assigned a distance of around B. If A is "close" to C then
X will also be around to C. However if A is "far" from D. D remains 'lost' to
X unless X moves up close to A.  Something like this anyways.

# Fluid dynamics
Part of the reason for all this is that the euze is fluid and dynamic. Nobody
remains at rest. If no action is taken, bodies drift. Although bodies near 
(close) will drift in tandem for a time, eventually they will drift apart if
they remain passive. Staying within a range of any body is an active effort.

Far on the other hand is a transient state that reverts to "lost" unless the
bodies begin to move toward one another. Around and close can be maintained
with reasonable effort. Touching bodies might be able to clasp eachother to 
remain together without effort until one or both choose to release.

# Relative movement commands.
With reference to another body or the single fixed point, a body can issue a
command to approach or depart to move either closer or farther away.
A body can also choose to "orbit" to maintain relative distance
of close or around. Bodies can mutually "orbit" eachother which reduces the
effort required. Or one may remain passive and allow the other to orbit. If 
a passive orbit target chooses to depart from the orbiter, the orbiter must 
either expend additional effort to "approach" or let them slip away.

Only where one attempts to "approach" a body who is "departing" does a contest
or chase arrive. This will require resolution.


# Position and communication
Different forms of communication require different distances. (other factors 
may also enable or prevent communication like eunoia, trust, or intimacy.) 
But perhaps 'signals' require closeness. Kissing might require touching etc.

# Position and Eunoia
If eunoia is the score one gets from association with attractive bodies... then
touching, closeness, and being around(?) can confer eunoia perhaps over time.
