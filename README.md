# eunoia
A sub-game of Love is the Game is Death: Eunoia is just about finding love in a dark and lonely universe.
Players race against the clock to find mates before they die. They compete with
eachother and with annoying "itchbots" for the attention and affection of other
players.


# ToDo

## Things to plan
login and character creation. 
There should be a clear separation between account and character. As I wrote in the forum recently
I'm thinking of using multisessionmode=0. Players by default begin in a lobby like limbo where they
can chat and use all default Evennia commands. However if they choose to enter the 'game' they will
lose their game entity and be imposed upon a 'body' that lives in the game soup of Eunoia. 

In Eunoia they lose all default commands and have only eunoiac commands. They also lose their name and everything.
