# eunoia
A sub-game of Love is the Game is Death: Eunoia is just about finding love in a dark and lonely universe.
Players race against the clock to find mates before they die. They compete with
eachother and with annoying "itchbots" for the attention and affection of other
players.


# Todo list

## unit tests

* test for silence conditions I guess.

## Silence Project

Remove player communication
* say
* pose
* whisper
* setdesc

Still need to remove the Comms type commands and limit them to admin
broadcast and maybe a help channel.

## Bare commands

Might be better to drastically reduce the default commandset. Look in 
settings or someplace to simply refer to an alternative default.
